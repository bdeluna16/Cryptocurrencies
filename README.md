# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

In this project we were tasked with using the unsupervised learning method to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for investment purposes. With the data given to us we processed it to fit the machine learning models used, in this case a clustering algorithm, created DataFrames of our output, and plotted the data with elbow curves, 3D plots, and scatter plots.
